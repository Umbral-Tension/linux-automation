# * This script uses rsync to create full and incremental backups of the directories src(1)-src(n) in the directory backups.
# 
# * To achieve the incremental backups rsync is used as follows: rsync -avPh --link-dest=DIR --delete SRC... [DEST]
#     * --link-dest=DIR instructs rsync to search through DIR on the DEST machine for an exact match to the files in SRC. If
#     it finds a match, a hard link is made in DEST pointing to that file in DIR, rather than the file being copied from SRC 
#     to DEST. In this script --link-dest=DIR is set to a symlink that points to the latest backup. Therefore, for each file
#     in SRC rsync finds its match in the latest backup and, if it  hasn't changed, hardlinks to it. The hardlinking allows
#     for many incremental backups to be made with little more storage than is required for a single full backup. 
#         * The first time the script is run "current" doesn't exist, so rsync ignores the --link-dest option and does a full 
#         copy of SRC to DEST, i.e. "a full backup". Full and icnremental backups are labeled as such in their directory name.  
#         * Because rsync ignores non-existent --link-dest, accidentally or intenntionally deleting current symlink  or its 
#         target just results in a new full backup being created.                
#     
#     * --delete Allows file deletions in SRC to be reflected in DEST. That is, if a file in SRC is deleted, the next time rsync 
#     runs it will delete that file in DEST. 
#     
# * Note: If one of SRC does not exist, rsync still exits with code 0. The backup will not be marked failed, and the non-existent
#   SRC directory will not appear in that or subsequent backups, but it will still exist in previous backups. 
# * Note: After a failed backup current points to the latest backup that succeeded. Subsequent backups may be run with no consequence.
